Building the Algol F Compiler and Algol F Library

If the optional assembler source code libraries has been
installed then the Algol F Compiler and the Algol F Library can
be built from the installed source code libraries.

The build process for the Algol F Compiler is a two step process.
Member ASMCALL in the ALGOL.F.COMPILER.CNTL data set contains the
JCL to assemble all of the Algol F Compiler assembler source
modules into an object library. Member LINKC in the
ALGOL.F.COMPILER.CNTL data set contains the JCL and the Linkage
Editor control statements to Link Edit the Algol F Compiler
object modules to create the Algol F Compiler load module
library.

The build process for the Algol F Library is similar to the build
process for the Algol F Compiler in that it is a two step
process. Member ASMRTALL in the ALGOL.F.COMPILER.CNTL data set
contains the JCL to assemble all of the Algol F Library assembler
source modules into an object library. Member LINKRT in the
ALGOL.F.COMPILER.CNTL data set contains the JCL and the Linkage
Editor control statements to Link Edit the Algol F Library object
modules to create the Algol F Library load modules.
