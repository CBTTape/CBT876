//***FILE 876 is from Tom Armstrong, and contains the ALGOL F       *   FILE 876
//*           Version 2.1 compiler.  This is a complete reworking   *   FILE 876
//*           of the ALGOL F version 2 compiler from IBM, for       *   FILE 876
//*           which the materials are contained in CBT Overflow     *   FILE 876

//*           Included in this file is the ALGOL F 2.1 compiler     *   FILE 876
//*           and library, in source and executable code.  All of   *   FILE 876
